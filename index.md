# Introduction

ADAMANT is a **decentralized** messenger powered by a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain. Anyone can run a node and interact with the network via REST and WebSocket APIs.

You don’t have to run your own node to use the ADAMANT Messenger. It’s safe to use public nodes — all messages and transactions are **encrypted and signed locally** before being sent.

## Join the Decentralization

### Run own node

While you can connect to any ADAMANT node with an enabled API, it is recommended to [run your own node](https://news.adamant.im/how-to-run-your-adamant-node-on-ubuntu-990e391e8fcc) for the following reasons:

- **Support decentralization** – More nodes means stronger network
- **Robust performance** – Requests are processed faster through your own node.
- **High reliability** – You maintain full control over the API’s availability

To get started, check out the [Installation](/own-node/installation.md) and [Configuration](/own-node/configuration.md) guides — they cover everything you need to install, sync, and run a node.

You can also run a [Testnet node](/own-node/testnet.md) to experiment and try out different things in a safe environment.

::: tip
If you're building a service with a near-100% uptime requirement, implement a health check in your application — similar to [adamant-api-jsclient](https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-api-jsclient/blob/07016c89b57863ac379ebfcbf6cf464a0639d3b1/src/api/index.ts#L183) or [the ADAMANT PWA](https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-im/blob/f5c7b7ce95fb5df3785a3458abc4e0b132c18791/src/lib/nodes/abstract.client.ts). While connecting to public nodes is possible, running three or more separate ADAMANT nodes is significantly more reliable.

### Become a delegate

ADAMANT uses a **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** consensus. By running a node and meeting the criteria, you can [register as a delegate](https://news.adamant.im/how-to-become-an-adamant-delegate-745f01d032f), forge blocks, and earn rewards while contributing to network security.

## Public Nodes

To use ADAMANT, you can connect to any public node, such as:

```csv
https://lake.adamant.im
https://endless.adamant.im
https://ahead.adamant.im
https://sunshine.adamant.im
https://tauri.adm.im
```

However, **we still recommend running your own node** for reliability and performance and to help support decentralized messaging.

## Interacting with the nodes

If you're building a tool or app on the ADAMANT blockchain, you can use the REST API to interact with the network.

For real-time applications — such as messengers, or bots — the WebSocket API provides instant updates and optimal performance.

### Choosing a node

You can connect to **any public node** in the ADAMANT network.

To ensure you're on the correct network, check the node’s `nethash`. For the **mainnet**, the `nethash` is:

```
bd330166898377fb28743ceef5e43a5d9d0a3efd9b3451fb7bc53530bb0a6d64
```

You can check a node's `nethash` in its config or using the [`/api/blocks/getNethash`](/api-endpoints/blockchain.md#get-blockchain-nethash) endpoint. For example:

```url
https://endless.adamant.im/api/blocks/getNethash
```

### Community Libraries & Tools

This list includes some libraries and frameworks to interact with ADAMANT nodes **developed by the ADAMANT community**.

- **adamant-api-jsclient**. JavaScript framework to interact with ADAMANT REST and WebSocket API with reliability in mind.
